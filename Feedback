\usepackage[detect-all,per-mode=symbol]{siunitx}

Tool added additional $ when it is already provided as a inline equation
Original:
$\num{5408} - \num{4025.56} =  \qty{1382.44}{\kilo\electronvolt}$. 
converted:
$$5408$ - $4025.56$ =  $1382.44\,\mathrm{keV}$$

\Mathrm is missing in the below instances.
Original:
Where \(  n(t)\) has the dimension of neutron density (\unit{n/cm^3}) and  $g(\bm{r})$  has the dimension of a motion  (\unit{cm/s}).
Converted:
Where \(  n(t)\) has the dimension of neutron density ($n/cm^3$) and  $g(\bm{r})$  has the dimension of a motion  ($cm/s$).


\Mathrm is missing for "MS" and also changed 
Original:
\SI{100}{MS\per\milli\second}
Converted
$100\,MS\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$


original 
{\SIrange{0}{5}{\volt}}
converted 
$0 \text{--} 5\,\mathrm{V}$
Correct code is
$0 \mathrm{to} 5\,\mathrm{V}$

Instead of superscript minus 1 slash should be used since in preamble it was mentioned as \usepackage[detect-all,per-mode=symbol]
original  
\si{\kelvin\per\watt}
converted
$\mathrm{KW}^{-1}$


Kindly find the below feedbacks in running the SI units tool

1. \qtyrange{10}{30}{\MeV} changed to 10 \text{--} 30\,\mathrm{MeV} (correct output 10 to 30 MeV)

2. \unit{\elementarycharge\squared} changed to ^{2} (correct output e^{2})

other feedbacks

\to coding unwanted change to \mathrm{to} actual rightarrow symbol
\C coding unwanted change to \mathrm{C} has to be retained as it is.
